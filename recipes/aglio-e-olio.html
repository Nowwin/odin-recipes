    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This pasta recipe is a simple Italian classic you'll find in trattorias all across Italy. 
        “Pantry” meals that take less than 15 minutes to make, each makes enough for 6 people. 
        A tip for canned tomatoes - not all canned tomatoes are created equal. Good quality ones are 
        naturally sweet with better tomato flavour, poor quality ones are sour and often unripe tomatoes. 
        If needed, add sugar to sweeten tomatoes.
    </p>

    <p>
        Key step (especially for simple pastas like these) - 
        tossing the sauce with the cooked pasta and a splash of pasta cooking water. 
        The fat in the sauce reacts with the starch in the cooking water, thickening the sauce and 
        making it stick to the pasta strands. This is the proper way to make pasta - no self respecting 
        Italian or restaurant would ever skip this step!
